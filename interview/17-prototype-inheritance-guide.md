# Prototype Inheritance and Prototype Chain Guide

## Core Concept
- **Prototype inheritance** is JavaScript's mechanism for sharing properties and methods between objects through a reference link called the prototype.
- üå≥ **Mental Model**: Think of it as a family tree where objects inherit traits from their ancestors, with each generation linking back to previous ones.
- **Visual Representation**:
  ```
  myObject ‚Üí myObject.__proto__ ‚Üí ParentObject.prototype ‚Üí ParentObject.__proto__ ‚Üí Object.prototype ‚Üí null
  ```

## Key Mechanics

```javascript
// Constructor function
function Animal(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

// Adding method to prototype
Animal.prototype.speak = function() {
  return `${this.name} makes a sound`;
};

// Child constructor
function Dog(name, breed) {
  Animal.call(this, name); // Call parent constructor
  this.breed = breed;
}

// Create inheritance link
Dog.prototype = Object.create(Animal.prototype);
Dog.prototype.constructor = Dog;

// Override parent method
Dog.prototype.speak = function() {
  return `${this.name} barks`;
};

const rex = new Dog("Rex", "German Shepherd");
console.log(rex.speak()); // "Rex barks"
console.log(rex instanceof Dog);  // true
console.log(rex instanceof Animal); // true
```

- üîó Every JavaScript object has an internal link to another object called its **prototype**. When a property is accessed, JavaScript first looks on the object itself, then its prototype, then the prototype's prototype, and so on.

- üèóÔ∏è The **constructor function** creates objects, and its `.prototype` property becomes the `__proto__` of instances created with `new`.

- üß¨ The **prototype chain** is a series of linked objects that enables property/method lookup and inheritance. It ends at `Object.prototype`, whose prototype is `null`.

- üîÑ Methods like `Object.create()` and `Object.setPrototypeOf()` allow for explicit **prototype manipulation** and inheritance chains.

## Interview Mastery

**Q1: How does prototypal inheritance differ from classical inheritance?**  
A: Prototypal inheritance uses live object links rather than classes. In JavaScript, objects inherit directly from other objects through the prototype chain, not from classes as in languages like Java. It's more flexible, dynamic, and memory-efficient since methods are shared references, not copies.

**Q2: How would you prevent properties from being added to an object?**  
A: Use `Object.freeze(obj)` to make an object immutable (properties can't be added, removed, or changed). For just preventing new properties while allowing modification of existing ones, use `Object.preventExtensions(obj)` or `Object.seal(obj)` (which also prevents property deletion).

**Critical Connections:**
- üè≠ **Constructor Functions**: The traditional way to implement prototype inheritance before ES6 classes, still the underlying mechanism even with class syntax.
- üì¶ **ES6 Classes**: Syntactic sugar over prototype inheritance that provides a more familiar syntax for developers coming from class-based languages.

**Remember:** üí° JavaScript prototype inheritance is all about objects linking to other objects, creating a dynamic lookup chain that enables code reuse without duplicating methods in memory.
