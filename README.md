Create a comprehensive markdown guide to JavaScript [] Concept. This should be a complete learning resource following advanced cognitive science principles.
Focus especially on these key elements:

- Clear definition and mental models that build mastery
- Progressive code examples from basic to advanced
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- Expert-level insights not found in basic documentation
  Please create this as a markdown artifact that I can reference and study.
